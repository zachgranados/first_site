<h2>Geographical Location: Asia</h2>


<p>Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO world heritage site and a popular tourist destination in northeast Vietnam. The bay is famous for its crystal clear emerald colored waters dotted with limestone mountains that rise up from the water. Many tourists visit and take boat tours around the islands that tend to me named after their peculiar shape. For instance, tourists can take kayak expeditions around the Teapot islets, a set of islands shaped like teapots, or be rowed around Stone Dog, which appears to be shaped like a dog.</p>

<p>The Ha Long Bay region is popular for scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking, particularly in mountainous Cát Bà National Park. The nearest city is Hai Phong, which is approximately 75 km away. It is easier to reach Ha Long Bay by boat because the journey from Hai Phong to Ha Long Bay can take nearly 2.5 hours.</p>
